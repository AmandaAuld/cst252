<h1>Lab 17- Object-Oriented Design</h1>

<div id="description">

	<h1>Problem</h1>

	<p>In this lab we learned how to create JavaScript classes and constructors.</p>

	<h1>Challenges</h1>

	<p>I did not have any challenges in this lab, I found it to be pretty straightforward.<p>

	<h1>Result</h1>

	<p id="results">In this lab I experimented in the console, created a JavaScript file for my lab 17 page,
		and designed my lab 17 page.</p>

    <h3>Hangman OOP</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>One player thinks of a word and the rest of the players guess the word one letter at a time.[Player]</li>
      <li>The chosen player writes a number of dashes equal to the word length [Player + Hangman]</li>
      <li>If the guessing player gets a letter correct, the writing player fills out the letter in the correct spots [Player + Hangman]</li>
      <li>If the letter is not in the word, the writing player draws a pieve of the hangman's gallows. [Player + Hangman]</li>
      <li>Once the hangman's gallows is fully completed, the game ends. [Hangman]</li>
      <li>The first player to guess the correct word, gets to choose the next word. [Hangman]</li>
    </ol>

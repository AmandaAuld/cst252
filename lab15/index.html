<h1>Lab 15- Basic Debugging</h1>

<div id="description">

	<h1>Problem</h1>

	<p>In this lab we learned basic debugging strategies and were prompted to debug our past labs.</p>

	<h1>Challenges</h1>

	<p>I did not have any challenges in this lab, I found it to be pretty straightforward.<p>

	<h1>Result</h1>

	<p id="results">In this lab I fixed my lab 10 webpage. I could not figure out
     how to scramble the users name but I used Trinity's JavaScript for reference and fixed the mistakes in my lab.</p>

<h1>Debugging</h1>
<p id="debugging">My lab 10 had a mistake with an innerHTML line where I had not defined the heading that it was trying to change.</p>

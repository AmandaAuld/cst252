	<h1>Hello World!</h1>

	<p>Gracie is my partner for this lab and she is very hard working in
		everything that she does. We are both from the Central Valley and played
		tennis in high school. I have done Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu for most of my life
		and Gracie has been a dancer for most of her life as well. We are both 2nd
		years and our concentrations are visual design.</p>
